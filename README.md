# RC210_Data_Assistant
This project supports the Arcom Controllers model RC210 repeater controller by providing the user 
with english decoded data from the numerical output of the download from the controller. The output
is in two forms. First is an html file and second is the printed output of that file. 

James Bolding, KC5 is the originator of this project and Bob Norris has been updates as changes in
firmware have been released over the years.
